When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2).\\n2. These molecules scatter the light in all directions, but they scatter shorter (blue) wavelengths more than longer (red) wavelengths.\\n3. This is because the smaller molecules are more effective at scattering the shorter blue wavelengths, while the longer red wavelengths pass through the atmosphere with less scattering.\\n4. As a result, our eyes perceive the sky as blue, because we see mostly the scattered blue light.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that the color of the sky can change depending on various factors, such as:\\n\\n* Time of day: During sunrise and sunset, the sky can take on hues of orange, pink, and red due to scattering by atmospheric particles.\\n* Atmospheric conditions: Dust, pollution, and water vapor in the air can scatter light in different ways, altering the color of the sky.\\n* Altitude and location: The color of the sky can vary depending on your location and altitude. For example, the sky can appear more intense blue at higher altitudes.\\n\\nSo, to summarize, the sky appears blue because of the scattering of sunlight by tiny molecules in the atmosphere, with shorter wavelengths (blue light) being scattered more than longer wavelengths (red light).\", 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [128006, 9125, 128007, 271, 38766, 1303, 33025, 2696, 25, 6790, 220, 2366, 18, 271, 128009, 128006, 882, 128007, 271, 10445, 374, 279, 13180, 6437, 30, 128009, 128006, 78191, 128007, 271, 791, 13180, 8111, 6437, 1606, 315, 264, 25885, 2663, 13558, 64069, 72916, 11, 7086, 1306, 279, 8013, 83323, 10425, 13558, 64069, 11, 889, 1176, 7633, 433, 304, 279, 3389, 220, 777, 339, 9478, 382, 8586, 596, 1148, 8741, 1473, 16, 13, 3277, 40120, 29933, 9420, 596, 16975, 11, 433, 35006, 13987, 35715, 315, 45612, 1778, 439, 47503, 320, 45, 17, 8, 323, 24463, 320, 46, 17, 4390, 17, 13, 4314, 35715, 45577, 279, 3177, 304, 682, 18445, 11, 719, 814, 45577, 24210, 320, 12481, 8, 93959, 810, 1109, 5129, 320, 1171, 8, 93959, 627, 18, 13, 1115, 374, 1606, 279, 9333, 35715, 527, 810, 7524, 520, 72916, 279, 24210, 6437, 93959, 11, 1418, 279, 5129, 2579, 93959, 1522, 1555, 279, 16975, 449, 2753, 72916, 627, 19, 13, 1666, 264, 1121, 11, 1057, 6548, 45493, 279, 13180, 439, 6437, 11, 1606, 584, 1518, 10213, 279, 38067, 6437, 3177, 382, 2181, 596, 5922, 27401, 430, 279, 1933, 315, 279, 13180, 649, 2349, 11911, 389, 5370, 9547, 11, 1778, 439, 1473, 9, 4212, 315, 1938, 25, 12220, 64919, 323, 44084, 11, 279, 13180, 649, 1935, 389, 82757, 315, 19087, 11, 18718, 11, 323, 2579, 4245, 311, 72916, 555, 45475, 19252, 627, 9, 87597, 4787, 25, 33093, 11, 25793, 11, 323, 3090, 38752, 304, 279, 3805, 649, 45577, 3177, 304, 2204, 5627, 11, 60923, 279, 1933, 315, 279, 13180, 627, 9, 24610, 3993, 323, 3813, 25, 578, 1933, 315, 279, 13180, 649, 13592, 11911, 389, 701, 3813, 323, 36958, 13, 1789, 3187, 11, 279, 13180, 649, 5101, 810, 19428, 6437, 520, 5190, 4902, 21237, 382, 4516, 11, 311, 63179, 11, 279, 13180, 8111, 6437, 1606, 315, 279, 72916, 315, 40120, 555, 13987, 35715, 304, 279, 16975, 11, 449, 24210, 93959, 320, 12481, 3177, 8, 1694, 38067, 810, 1109, 5129, 93959, 320, 1171, 3177, 570], 'total_duration': 3695112700, 'load_duration': 1912685200, 'prompt_eval_count': 31, 'prompt_eval_duration': 59376000, 'eval_count': 301, 'eval_duration': 1720083000}\n"
