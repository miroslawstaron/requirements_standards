This model facilitates the dynamic adaptation of network slices to meet the specific requirements of VAL application User Equipments (UEs). The procedure is divided into several steps, each with distinct responsibilities and interactions between the VAL server and the NSCE server.\n\n1. The VAL server initiates the network slice adaptation process by sending a request to the NSCE server. This request specifies the desired network slice and, optionally, the Deep Neural Network (DNN) parameters for all VAL UEs within the application. The request may also include an adaptation threshold, which defines the conditions under which the network slice adaptation should be triggered.\n\n2. Optionally, the NSCE server collects network slice status information, including performance measurements, key performance indicators, and end-to-end latency analytics. This information is sourced from network slice management functions and streamed or filed data reporting services, as defined in the 3GPP standards.\n\n3. The NSCE server processes the request and, based on the collected network slice status information, determines whether the current network slice meets the adaptation criteria. If the criteria are met, the NSCE server triggers the network slice configuration for each VAL UE within the application.\n\n4. The NSCE server, acting as an Access Function (AF), provides the updated Service Network Slice Subscription Application Interface (S-NSSAI) and DNN information to the Policy Control Function (PCF) via the Network Element Function (NEF). This guidance updates the route selection parameters, indicating different sets of PDU Session information (DNN S-NSSAI) that can be associated with applications matching the application traffic.\n\n5. Upon successful adaptation of the route selection parameters, the NSCE server sends a network slice adaptation response to the VAL server.</td>

      <td>Requirement:\n\n6.4.1 General\n\nIn this release, the Local PSA UPF (Policy Service Access Point) is required to expose real-time network information, such as user path latency, to the local Access Function (AF). This information should be provided in the form of QoS (Quality of Service) monitoring results, as defined in clause 5.33.3 of TS 23.501 [2]. The delivery of this information to the local AF should be facilitated via N6, although the specifics of how to deliver the information on N6 are beyond the scope of this document.\n\nIt is important to note that the QoS monitoring information should not be sent with an over-high frequency, as this can increase the risk of the application over-reacting to instantaneous radio events or conditions. This could potentially lead to service instability. Therefore, the QoS monitoring results should be properly integrated over time to ensure a stable and reliable service.\n\n[1] This requirement is applicable to all network elements that are part of the local AF and are responsible for providing QoS monitoring results to the local AF.\n\n[2] TS 23.501 is a technical specification for the Ethernet in the First Mile (E-FMM) network architecture. It defines the requirements for the E-FMM network elements, including the local AF and the PSA UPF.</td>
