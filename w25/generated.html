      <td>**4.1 General Requirements for Edge Computing**\n\n4.1.1 **Purpose and Scope**\n\nThis section outlines the general requirements for Edge Computing within the context of 5G networks. Edge Computing is designed to host operator and third-party services close to the User Equipment (UE)'s access point of attachment. The primary objectives are to achieve efficient service delivery through reduced end-to-end latency and load on the transport network.\n\n4.1.2 **Edge Hosting Environment (EHE)**\n\n- The Edge Hosting Environment (EHE) should support the deployment of services beyond the Public Switched Algebraic Interface (PSA) Upstream Functional Node (UPF). EHEs can be managed by either operators or third parties.\n- EHEs should be capable of supporting both Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) and System Nodes Public Network (SNPN) features as defined in the specification.\n\n4.1.3 **Latency and Load Reduction**\n\n- Edge Computing should contribute to the reduction of end-to-end latency and the load on the transport network by hosting services closer to the UE.\n- The architecture should facilitate local routing and traffic steering, ensuring session and service continuity.\n\n4.1.4 **User Plane Connectivity**\n\n- The Local Part of the Distribution Network Node (DN) where EHE is deployed should maintain user plane connectivity with both centrally deployed PSA and locally deployed PSA of the same Distribution Network Node (DNN).\n- The Edge Computing enablers, as described in clause 5.13 of TS 23.501 [2], should be leveraged to optimize the network performance and user experience.\n\n4.1.5 **Application Functional Node (AF) Influence**\n\n- Edge Computing should utilize Application Functional Node (AF) influenced traffic routing to enhance network efficiency and service delivery.\n\n4.1.6 **Local Break Out Roaming Scenario**\n\n- Edge Computing in the serving network should support scenarios such as Local Break Out roaming in case of PLMN access.

      <td>6.3.1 General:\n\nThis section outlines the general procedures and mechanisms related to Edge Relocation, which is a critical aspect of ensuring efficient and optimized user plane path configuration.

      <td>* This part of the standard contains a figure, the generated requirement can be inaccurate, please consult the original text for details.\n\n6.3.6 Edge Relocation Considering User Plane Latency Requirement\n\nThe Service Management Function (SMF) shall consider user plane latency requirements provided by the Access Federation (AF) when deciding on edge relocation of the Packet Data User Equipment (PDUE) to a Packet Data User Equipment Function (PDUEF). This decision-making process is influenced by the AF's traffic steering enforcement control, which is informed to the SMF via the Access Control Function (ACF) once the user plane latency requirements are authorized by the Policy Control Function (PCF).\n\nThe SMF shall use the maximum allowed user plane latency value provided by the AF to determine whether edge relocation is necessary to ensure that the user plane latency does not exceed this value. If the serving PDUE does not satisfy the maximum allowed user plane latency, the SMF may opt to relocate the PDUE to a target PDUEF that meets the latency requirements. In such cases, the SMF shall select the PDUEF with the shortest user plane latency among those satisfying the maximum user plane latency requirements.\n\nThe PCF is responsible for authorizing the AF's request for user plane latency requirements. The PCF checks whether the AF has the authority to make such a request. Once authorized, the AF's request, including the latency requirements, is communicated to the SMF via the ACF.\n\nUpon receiving the user plane latency requirements, the SMF may take appropriate actions to meet these requirements. This may involve reconfiguring the user plane of the Packet Data Unit (PDU) Session, as described in step 6 of Figure 4.3.6.2-1 in TS 23.502 [3]. The SMF's actions should consider the user plane latency requirements to ensure that the user experience is optimized and meets the AF's expectations.</td>

      <td>6.4.1 General:\n\nThis section outlines the general requirements for exposing real-time network information, such as user path latency, which are beneficial for the application layer. Specifically, the Local PSA UPF (User Plane Services Access Function) is mandated to expose Quality of Service (QoS) monitoring results as per clause 5.33.3 of TS 23.501 [2]. These results are intended to be delivered to the local Access Function (AF) to enhance network performance and user experience.\n\nIt is important to note that the method of delivering this information on Network Service Element (N6) is not covered in this document. This aspect is considered beyond the scope of the current release.\n\nFurthermore, it is crucial to ensure that the QoS monitoring information is properly integrated over time and not sent with an excessively high frequency. This is to mitigate the risk of the application layer over-reacting to transient radio events or conditions. Such over-reactions could potentially lead to service instability, thereby affecting the overall network performance and user experience.</td>
